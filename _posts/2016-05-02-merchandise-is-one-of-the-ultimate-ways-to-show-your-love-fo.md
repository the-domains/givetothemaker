Merchandise is one of the ultimate ways to show your love for a game. It's an obsession to find that thing that represents a banner of appreciation for the pixelated warmth in your heart. In the following piece I'm going to tell you why you should care about Give to the Maker.

So why independent video game merchandise?!

There are a few reasons...

1\. Independent games always need money. If you are established studio merchandise is additional income. If independent developers made the kind of money large studios did from merchandise, it would give them more freedom, more expression and help them make better games.

2\. I think Kickstarter is brilliant, revolutionary even, and I know that lots of independent games are made from its support. Personally though it doesn't feel accessible to me. I know you can get cool limited edition stuff and discounts, among other things, if you are willing to put down big enough donations. But the distinction I will make is buying something to support a game being made, or even pre-existing independent game. When you buy something big or small and you still feel like you are contributing then that is much more accessible to me. I know independent video game merchandise is not currently a large industry, but I'm starting this because I think it should be. I'm not going to tell a developer what to use the money on. Ultimately I just want them to make a good game, to inspire me, excite me, and to suspend my time in reality to another place.

I also think as a truly independent free-thinking medium, there should be more creativity. Independent game developers shouldn't want to be large studios. There should be more expansion on simple ideas. I think there are people that can and want to achieve that. This is what Give to the Maker will support, and you will support with the merchandise you buy here.

3\. Do you ever feel let down by video game merchandise? Some stuff is cool but let's be honest, there is a lot of crap. Companies shouldn't milk people's love of a game. You must have been on websites where you think "Wow that's amazing!" and then go on another website with exactly the same products made by exactly the same people, with a different image slapped on the front of it. It's condescending to the gamer that puts hours in to games to be spoon fed products with no heart or imagination. Then you think about that game and all the possibilities for merchandise, often realised and made by fans rather than companies. I don't expect people to support games by buying cheap crap. I want to sell high quality merchandise that first and foremost customers would want to buy anyway.

4\. I know one thing when starting this company. Independent developers don't think merchandise will make a sizeable difference to their ability to make games. This may be utopian and a head in the clouds mentality but I'm here to change that perception. I have no basis of fact other than if people will give money for nothing in return to support a game, then of course they will for something. But it's the perception of merchandise that will have to change. Independent video game merchandise can be special in its context. It can reach people that give to crowdfunding and people that never would. The power is inspiration, what could be, what will be, and what we together can make happen. Give to the Maker.

5\. 100% Authentic merchandise. You see this frequently with outlets that sell video game merchandise. They pay for a license and then that's that. I want to partner with developers. I don't want silent clients. Official designs, videos promoting the game, promoting the product. If I'm a consumer buying this merchandise I want to know the developer I'm supporting cares too. Faceless is boring, shallow and without purpose.

6\. I go on some websites and they are stale, no personality. Give to the Maker will be an event. It has a style, a brand, and will represent its core values through multiple creative mediums. This will be THE platform for independent merchandise. Games that sell here will be interesting, innovative, and new, by talented ambitious developers. Nobody is universally loved, so I want to bring an honest perspective that connects with specific audiences. It also doesn't mean I don't like popular games, because like everyone I do. But to represent something you cannot have everything.

Furthermore there are many possibilities for expansion on the format. Developers work with musicians and artists, well how about digital release events? Have the band play a concert, playing the music from the game, screens from the game playing behind them, appearance from the developers, also live streaming on the homepage. Increased exposure for the game and the collaborators that helped make it happen. Like I said an event, not just click, buy and close.

We all imagine ourselves as we would like to be, but why can't that be our lives? For me I have always wanted to work for myself, freedom of choice, of location, of creativity. I have always worked hard, but now is an opportunity to put that work into soul, out of the grind and monotonous floundering, into running at full speed to my goals. I feel I'm better placed to provide a service people want because I'm a consumer, sometimes silently dissatisfied and ready to deliver a different point of view. Life begins not at 30 or 40, and the best years of your life are not when you're growing up. Life begins when you decide to live it. So I will (Shit I'm already apprehensive).

Give to the Maker will be starting life on thegrid.io (if beta testing prevails). More content will be available here on its continued development up until release. But for now this is me signing off...
