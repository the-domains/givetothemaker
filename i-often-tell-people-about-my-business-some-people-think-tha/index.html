<p>I often tell people about my business, some people think that it’s cool, some people don’t care or don’t get it and some people think that it’s good but why wouldn’t developers just do it for themselves. What can you possibly offer? Connections in the gaming industry? Nope. Money? WHERE!?! QUICK SHOW ME WHERE IT IS!! So I figured the natural step is to write about my viewpoint on this argument.</p><p>These are some reasons why you would want to work with Give to the Maker:</p><p>1. Dedication</p><p>I’m going to be picky about who I work with. I am going to work with people I believe in, and because of that you won’t find someone more dedicated to putting together the best products for you. Publicizing the game whenever I can, pushing to get it made through my website, and that consumers are helping it to be made, or that it is available and amazing already. This might not seem like much, but also I know that independent developers are conscious that any different avenue their game is exposed in is a good one.  I’m told I shouldn’t be picky “just work with whoever wants you” blah blah blah, but dammitt no!!! It is my aim to love what I do, I will probably care more than I should, and I plan on doing a bloody good job.  Plus if I do absolutely anything how will that separate me from anyone else. Where’s the identity?!? </p><p>2. Core values</p><p>I believe in customer service. I’ve had good service and terrible service (and to be honest a lot of awful services from start-ups that offer the world, and are happy to sell products without knowing when the customer is actually going to get them).  I work in customer service, and I know how upsetting bad service can be. People are not my pawns for global domination, they are the reason the business would be successful, and should be treated like that. You want people to be happy with price, product and service. That will be all part of how people view my company, and your game. For example, if there is a premium product being sold, which customers might need to pre-order, then customers will know exactly how long it will be. There is no point lying or dressing up the truth. Do you have the time to offer that kind of service to your fans? Especially when you want to be spending your time working on your game.</p><p>The whole idea of working in tandem with the developer rather than paying for the license of making merchandise is this…I want you to make more money than that. I want the amount of money you make to be significant, and for you to say “I never thought it would happen, but I can do this because of Give To The Maker” I need to make some money as well, but honestly when I’ve looked for funding people have told me that I should be asking for way more than I want. I think lower margins, more sales, more fans, more people buying your game, and more people buying and helping other developers by buying from my website.  Plus a lot of suppliers will only add features dependent on quantity, meaning more of something made=a higher quality, more rounded, better product=happy customer. I work with UK suppliers for a few reasons. Firstly I don’t want someone to get paid 10p an hour making the merchandise. The second being as a start-up I can feasibly quality control what’s getting made, and make sure it’s to a high standard. Thirdly turnaround times will be quicker and thus again more satisfied customers.</p><p>3. New inventive ideas</p><p>I am currently in the process of getting some prototype products together, which quite frankly cost more than is sensible for me right now, but will be worth it to show there is more you can do than just the standard stuff you see in merchandise. If a one-off is expensive, fair enough, as long as a larger order means an affordable consumer product. That’s pretty cryptic, but I’m in touch with a supplier over one product, and hopefully I can show it soon. The point is, games have an identity, developers have an identity, and gamers love particular games because they connect with a certain piece of their imagination. So merchandise should reflect that.  You might only have the time to consider merchandise from a business perspective, but I have the time to also consider it from a fans’.</p><p>4. A different platform</p><p>As I have already mentioned, as a developer you know the value of getting your product out there. Even at just this point, working with me will be a success, one more avenue. You aren’t exclusive to working with me, just the products, so if you want to sell something somewhere else too, go ahead, if you want to sell on your own store, go ahead. It’s only important to me that you visibly endorse what is on Give to the Maker. I’ve spoken to developers that will only sell through one place or only through themselves, again which is counterproductive. I trust in my ability to give you a service that without restriction of other options you will eventually consider Give to the Maker the home of your merchandise.  I also believe that the power of a good brand means that people stumble upon your merchandise, your game, in a way that you don’t get by only having your own store.</p><p>5. A new perspective on selling merchandise</p><p>The most important thing. This is crowdfunding through merchandise.  This is independent video game merchandise. Encouraging people to buy merchandise to support freedom of creativity in your video games, is something to be part of, to be proud of. You’re not standing there with your hand out, you’re offering something people want, to play something better, maybe to add that something extra to your game that you couldn’t before, even to go that extra mile before launch. People want to be part of something, you should too. If I can’t get you to see that perspective then consumers won’t buy into it.</p><p>==============================================================================</p><p>This is a shout out to all independent video game developers. What I want is input, registration of interest, comments good or bad. Anything. Every time I talk to someone about this concept, this business, I want brutal honesty. I’m not the kind to be deterred. If you stumble upon this information page or if I give you one of my business cards at a conference, leave me a comment, give me a call, I’m more than happy to hear from you.  By at least the end of next year I want this to be my job, therefore your honesty, your opinion; all serve as input to my Johnny Five.</p><p>Signing off</p><p>Andrew</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">GivetotheMaker</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
